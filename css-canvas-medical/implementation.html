              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
              determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
              unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
              information as possible to make this determination one way or the
              other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas
              application for you to get a feel for the platform as well as
              references to current customers to talk about their experience.

              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
              community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your
              fax number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and
              getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your
              preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
              sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if
              interfaces with health information exchanges or other information
              technology vendors are important, we will work with you to
              determine what we can deliver and when.

              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
              current data, which we have executed successfully with both
              remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins
              to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like
              medications, problems, and allergies is relatively
              straightforward. While importing clinical notes ad documents is
              more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high
              level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including
              clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based
              trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize
              relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and
              billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
              team can visit your practice to work side by side with you on
              implementation and training.

              Go live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your
              practice. We will be with you, either in-person or remotely
              depending on your preference, to make sure everything goes
              smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
              handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical
              microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying practice
              management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.

              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken
              promises and provide support over the long term. Our Performance
              Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can
              termiante the agreement and receive all payments back (We do not
              expect this to happen). For our standard plans we also offer a
              MIPS guarantee if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover
              it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no
              charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership for us
              both.
